# AWS RDS Custom for Oracle Module

This module provides prescriptive deployment for [RDS Custom for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/working-with-custom-oracle.html). This module provides the ability to create primary instances and associated replicas.

Common deployment examples can be found in [examples/](./examples).

## Resouces Created

* RDS Custom for Oracle primary instance using a precreated [Custom Engine Version (CEV)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html)
* (optional) [RDS Custom for Oracle replcia instance(s)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-rr.html) from the primary
* (optional) [IAM Role and Instance Profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc) for the primary and replicas
* (optional) [DBSubnet Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc) for the primary and replicas
* (optional) [Security Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html#custom-setup-orcl.iam-vpc) for the VPC endpoints, allowing the primary and replica instance(s) to communicate with dependent AWS services
* (optional) VPC endpoints, which are rquired for primary and replica instance(s) to communicate with dependent AWS services:
    * com.amazonaws.region.s3
    * com.amazonaws.region.ec2
    * com.amazonaws.region.ec2messages
    * com.amazonaws.region.monitoring
    * com.amazonaws.region.ssm
    * com.amazonaws.region.ssmmessages
    * com.amazonaws.region.logs
    * com.amazonaws.region.events
    * com.amazonaws.region.secretsmanager

## Prerequisites

RDS Custom for Oracle requires a [Custom Engine Version (CEV)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.html) to be created before creating the primary instance. The CEV must be created in the same region as the primary instance. The CEV must be created using customer managed symmetric AWS KMS Key.

For more information on RDS Custom for Oracle prerequisites, see [Prerequisites for using Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-setup-orcl.html).

For more information on creating a CEV, see [Creating a Custom Engine Version](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/custom-cev.create.html).

## Availability Zones

If not specified, primariy instances will be placed in the first subnet provided to `subnet_config`. Replicas will be placed in subnets separate from the primary, starting with the second subnet.

To specify the placement to specific availability zones for the primary and replicas, use the `aws_db_instance_primary.availability_zone` and `aws_db_instance_replicas.availability_zones` attribute(s). If specifified, availability_zones will be applied in order to the replicas.

## IAM Role and Instance Profile

If not specified, the module will create an IAM role and instance profile for the primary and replicas.

To specify the IAM role and instance profile, use the `iam_role_arn` and `iam_instance_profile_arn` attributes. The role name and instance profile name must start with `AWSRDSCustom`.

```hcl
  create_iam_role             = false # Toggle to create or assign IAM role. Defaut name and description will be used.
  iam_role_arn                = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSRDSCustomInstanceRole-us-west-2"
  create_iam_instance_profile = false # Toggle to create or assign IAM instance profile. Defaut name and description will be used.
  iam_instance_profile_arn    = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/AWSRDSCustomInstanceProfile-us-west-2"
```
