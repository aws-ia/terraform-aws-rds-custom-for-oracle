# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Module Standards

For best practices and information on developing with Terraform, see the [I&A Module Standards](https://aws-ia.github.io/standards-terraform/)

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests
In order to contribute code to this repository, you must submit a *[Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)*. To do so, you must *[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)* this repository, make your changes in your forked version and submit a *Pull Request*.

Before sending us a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the *master* branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

To send us a pull request, please:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are contributing. If you also reformat all the code, it will be hard for us to focus on your change.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your fork using clear commit messages.
5. Send us a pull request, answering any default questions in the pull request interface.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved in the conversation.

GitHub provides additional documentation on [forking a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and
[creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Writing Documentation

> :bangbang: **Do not manually update README.md**.

README.md is automatically generated by pulling in content from other files. For instructions, including a fill-in-the-blank content template, see [Create readmes for Terraform-based Partner Solutions.](https://aws-ia-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/docs/content/index.html#/lessons/8rpYWWL59M7dcS-NsjYmaISUu-L_UqEv)


## Checks and Validation

Pull Requests (PRs) submitted against this repository undergo a series of static and functional checks.

> :exclamation: Note: Failures during funtional or static checks will prevent a pull request from being accepted. 

It is a best practice to perform these checks locally prior to submitting a pull request.

## Checks Performed
- TFLint
- tfsec
- Markdown Lint
- Checkov
- Terratest

> :bangbang: The readme.md file will be created after all checks have completed successfully, it is recommended that you install terraform-docs locally in order to preview your readme.md file prior to publication.

## Install the required tools

Prerequisites:
- [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for macos you can use `brew`)
- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
- [tfsec](https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/v1.0.11/)
- [Markdown Lint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)
- [Checkov](https://www.checkov.io/2.Basics/Installing%20Checkov.html)
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)
- [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)

## Performing Checks manually

Preparation
```
terraform init
terraform validate
```
## Checks

### tflint
```
tflint --init
tflint
```
### tfsec
```
tfsec .
```
### Markdown Lint
```
mdl .header.md
```
### Checkov
```
terraform init
terraform plan -out tf.plan
terraform show -json tf.plan  > tf.json 
checkov 
```
### Terratest

Include tests to validate your examples/<> root modules, at a minimum. This can be accomplished with usually only slight modifications to the [boilerplate test provided in this template](./test/examples\_basic\_test.go)

```
# from the root of the repository
cd test
go mod init github.com/aws-ia/terraform-project-ephemeral
go mod tidy
go install github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform
go test -timeout 45m
```
